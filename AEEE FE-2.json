"solution": "Let's break down the statement:\n'I have no brother or sister' means the man speaking is an only child.\n'my father's son' - since he has no siblings, 'my father's son' must be himself.\nSo, the statement becomes 'that man's father is *me*'.\nIf 'that man's father is me', then 'that man' is the speaker's son.\nThus, the photograph was of his son.\nThus, the correct option is A."

"solution": "Ambiguous means open to more than one interpretation; having a double meaning; unclear or inexact.\nVague means of uncertain, indefinite, or unclear character or meaning. This is the closest synonym.\nClear, precise, and obvious are antonyms.\nThus, the correct option is B."

"svg": "",
"options": ["Adjective", "Noun", "Verb", "Adverb"],

"options": ["a", "an", "the", "no article needed"],
"correct": 1,
"solution": "The choice between 'a' and 'an' depends on the sound of the first letter of the following word. Even though 'honest' starts with 'h', the 'h' is silent, and the word begins with a vowel sound ('o').\nTherefore, 'an' is the correct article to use.\nThus, the correct option is B."

"options": ["Each of the students have submitted their assignments.", "Each of the students has submitted their assignments.", "Every student have submitted their assignments.", "All of the student has submitted their assignments."],
"correct": 1,
"solution": "The phrase 'Each of the students' takes a singular verb because 'each' is a singular indefinite pronoun. Therefore, 'has submitted' is correct.\n'Their assignments' is acceptable as a gender-neutral singular pronoun in informal contexts, though grammatically 'his or her' would be formal.\nOption B: 'Each of the students has submitted their assignments.' is the most grammatically acceptable among the choices.\nThus, the correct option is B."
