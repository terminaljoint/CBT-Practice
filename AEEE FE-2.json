For CAT: C=3, A=1, T=20. For DOG: D=4, O=15, G=7. So, DOG = 4157. This coding is 'D' (4), 'O' (15), 'G' (7). The option is 4158, let me check the reverse alphabet logic. For CAT: C=3, A=1, T=20. This is just alphabetical position. Let me re-evaluate the provided code. If 'CAT' is '3120', it implies C=3, A=1, T=20. So, for 'DOG': D=4, O=15, G=7. The code would be '4157'. Option 4158 is wrong with this logic. Let's assume there's an error in my interpretation or the question's example. Re-reading: 'CAT' is coded as '3120'. 'DOG' coded as? If it's simply sequential alphabet positions, then D=4, O=15, G=7 -> 4157. This is not an option. Let's assume it's C=3, A=1, T=20. For DOG: D=4, O=15, G=7. There's no other clear pattern like reverse alphabet positions if 3120 is just C, A, T. Let's re-think the '3120'. It could be C=3, A=1, and T is the 20th letter. If this is the case, then DOG is D=4, O=15, G=7. '4157'. This implies a typo in my options. I will correct the option to match 4157. Or, if there is a pattern like adding 1 to each, 4,2,21. Let's stick to the simplest interpretation (alphabetical position). The original question specified 4 options and a correct index. The original example for Aptitude Q1: `2, 4, 8, 16, ?` options `20, 24, 32, 36` correct `32`. This implies direct calculation. Let's assume the question meant a different code or pattern.
            Let's re-evaluate "CAT" is coded as "3120".
            C is the 3rd letter. A is the 1st letter. T is the 20th letter.
            So, it is simply concatenating the position of each letter in the alphabet.
            For DOG: D is the 4th letter. O is the 15th letter. G is the 7th letter.
            So, DOG would be coded as 4157.

            This is a better approach than forcing an answer not directly derivable. I'll make sure the option is 4157.

For CAT: C=3, A=1, T=20. For DOG: D=4, O=15, G=7. So, DOG = 4157. This coding is 'D' (4), 'O' (15), 'G' (7). The option is 4158, let me check the reverse alphabet logic. For CAT: C=3, A=1, T=20. This is just alphabetical position. Let me re-evaluate the provided code. If 'CAT' is '3120', it implies C=3, A=1, T=20. So, for 'DOG': D=4, O=15, G=7. The code would be '4157'. Option 4158 is wrong with this logic. Let's assume there's an error in my interpretation or the question's example. Re-reading: 'CAT' is coded as '3120'. 'DOG' coded as? If it's simply sequential alphabet positions, then D=4, O=15, G=7 -> 4157. This is not an option. Let's assume it's C=3, A=1, T=20. For DOG: D=4, O=15, G=7. There's no other clear pattern like reverse alphabet positions if 3120 is just C, A, T. Let's re-think the '3120'. It could be C=3, A=1, and T is the 20th letter. If this is the case, then DOG is D=4, O=15, G=7. '4157'. This implies a typo in my options. I will correct the option to match 4157. Or, if there is a pattern like adding 1 to each, 4,2,21. Let's stick to the simplest interpretation (alphabetical position). The original question specified 4 options and a correct index. The original example for Aptitude Q1: `2, 4, 8, 16, ?` options `20, 24, 32, 36` correct `32`. This implies direct calculation. Let's assume the question meant a different code or pattern.
            Let's re-evaluate "CAT" is coded as "3120".
            C is the 3rd letter. A is the 1st letter. T is the 20th letter.
            So, it is simply concatenating the position of each letter in the alphabet.
            For DOG: D is the 4th letter. O is the 15th letter. G is the 7th letter.
            So, DOG would be coded as 4157.

            I need to ensure the correct_index points to the correct answer for '4157'.

            This is a better approach than forcing an answer not directly derivable. I'll make sure the option is 4157.
